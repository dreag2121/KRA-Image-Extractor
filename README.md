# KRA-Image-Extractor
KRA-Image-Extractor is a Python script that automatically extracts mergedimage.png from .kra (Krita project) files and saves them as thumbnails. This is useful for quickly generating previews without opening Krita or for recovering your latest saved work if you forget to export.
